## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to create a mobile-first design and implement hover states for interactive elements. I also practiced using CSS filters to adjust brightness and CSS transitions to create smooth animations.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on improving my knowledge of responsive design techniques and exploring more advanced CSS features and animations.
